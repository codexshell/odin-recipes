    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Never fear! Making an omelette at home is not difficult. With a few basic
      steps and a flip of the wrist you can pull this off in minutes. Fill it
      with whatever you have on handâ€”it's a great way to use up leftovers!
    </p>
    <p>
      Not only is an omelette quick and easy to make, it is a paragon of
      economy. Odds and ends (a.k.a. leftovers) rise to a new level when placed
      inside an omelette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leftover, cooked vegetables paired with a little cheese and folded into
      eggs present a much more cheerful meal than a bowl of vegetables
      haphazardly reheated in the microwave!
